# Roadmap: Accrue

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 Initial Release** — Phases 1-9 shipped on 2026-04-16. Public Hex packages: `accrue` 0.1.2 and `accrue_admin` 0.1.2. Full archive: [`milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md).
- ✅ **v1.1 Stabilization + Adoption** — Phases 10-12 plus 11.1 shipped on 2026-04-17. Proved Accrue in a realistic Phoenix host app, promoted that proof into CI, closed host-flow hermeticity gaps, and hardened first-user DX/docs. Full archive: [`milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md).
- ✅ **v1.2 Adoption + Trust** — Phases 13-17 shipped on 2026-04-17. Polished the canonical local demo/tutorial, adoption front door, trust evidence, expansion recommendation, and final milestone cleanup. Full archive: [`milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md).
- ✅ **v1.3 Tax + Organization Billing** — Phases 18-22 shipped on 2026-04-17. Stripe Tax, Sigra-first organization billing, admin/host UX proof, and Stripe-native finance handoff documentation. Full archive: [`milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md`](milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md).
- ✅ **v1.4 Ecosystem stability + demo visuals** — Phase 23 shipped 2026-04-17. `lattice_stripe` lockfiles verified on latest 1.1.x; Fake-backed Playwright screenshot walkthrough documented and scripted; admin `priv/static` bundle fixed for browser LiveView. **PROC-08 deferred.**

## v1.4 Ecosystem stability + demo visuals

**Milestone goal:** Keep the Stripe client dependency current on published Hex within the `~> 1.1` contract, and make the existing host + mounted admin **visual** story trivial to reproduce locally and inspect from CI.

## Phases

- [x] **Phase 23: Ecosystem stability + demo visuals** — Refresh `lattice_stripe` lockfiles to latest 1.1.x; document and script the `@phase15-trust` screenshot walkthrough. **PROC-08** explicitly not in this phase.

## Phase details

### Phase 23: Ecosystem stability + demo visuals

**Goal:** Latest compatible `lattice_stripe` on Hex; evaluators can open full-page PNGs from the canonical Fake-backed Playwright walkthrough without spelunking the repo.

**Depends on:** Phase 22 (v1.3 complete)

**Requirements:** STAB-01, UX-DEMO-01

**Success criteria:**

1. `mix.lock` files in `accrue`, `accrue_admin`, and `examples/accrue_host` resolve the newest `lattice_stripe` allowed by `~> 1.1`; CI release gates remain green.
2. `examples/accrue_host/README.md` describes local screenshot output, optional HTML report, and the **`accrue-host-phase15-screenshots`** Actions artifact.
3. `examples/accrue_host/package.json` exposes a maintainer shortcut (e.g. `e2e:visuals`) for the tagged walkthrough only.

**Plans:** `23-01-PLAN.md` (lattice_stripe + verification), `23-02-PLAN.md` (visual walkthrough docs + npm script)

## Active roadmap

**v1.4 / Phase 23** is complete. Pick the next milestone in `PROJECT.md` / `ROADMAP.md` when planning resumes.

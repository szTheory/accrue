# Roadmap: Accrue

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.47 ENT-10 Polish + Adopter-Proof Completeness** — Phases 154-158 (shipped 2026-05-31) — [archive](milestones/v1.47-ROADMAP.md)
- ✅ **v1.48 Release Readiness + Stable Core Posture** — Phases 159-162 (shipped 2026-06-01) — [archive](milestones/v1.48-ROADMAP.md)
- ✅ **v1.49 Realistic Demo App & Adoption Evidence** — Phases 163-166 (shipped 2026-06-02) — [archive](milestones/v1.49-ROADMAP.md)

## Planning Doctrine

Accrue is in **stable core / demand-driven expansion** posture as of 2026-05-31. Future feature milestones require at least one of:

- a concrete adopter failure mode,
- a correctness/security/data-loss risk,
- a repeated support issue,
- an operational release/support failure,
- or an explicit strategy change recorded in `.planning/PROJECT.md` / `.planning/STRATEGY.md`.

After v1.48, broad feature milestones remain closed by default unless reopened by concrete adopter failure, correctness/security/data-loss risk, repeated support issue, operational failure, or explicit strategy change.

No broad feature milestone is currently open.

Stop rule: if proposed work is polish-only with a documented workaround and no release/adopter failure mode, record it as deferred with a revisit trigger and do not create a milestone for it.

## Historical Backlog Anchors (not active scope)

These v1.17 FRG anchors are retained for traceability only as historical, non-active planning context. They do not create milestone scope unless a fresh sourced friction row meets the current stable-core evidence bar.

- [INT-10 Phase 63](.planning/research/v1.17-FRICTION-INVENTORY.md#backlog--int-10-phase-63) — Historical / non-active Braintree and multi-processor integration anchor; materially shipped across v1.31+ and reflected in the processor support matrix. Reopen only for a concrete adopter failure mode or operational failure in the shipped processor-support contract.
- [BIL-03 Phase 64](.planning/research/v1.17-FRICTION-INVENTORY.md#backlog--bil-03-phase-64) — Historical / non-active billing portal configuration anchor; materially shipped via `accrue_portal`, guides, and host proof. Reopen only for a repeated support issue or correctness/data-loss risk in the portal support surface.
- [ADM-12 Phase 65](.planning/research/v1.17-FRICTION-INVENTORY.md#backlog--adm-12-phase-65) — Historical / non-active admin UI role-based access anchor; no current broad feature scope follows from this link. Reopen only for a concrete security/compliance requirement or explicit strategy change.

## Deferred Seeds and Ideas (dormant / trigger-bound)

| Item | Status | Reason | Future owner/category | Revisit trigger |
|------|--------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| SEED-001 | resolved historical context | Linked-release purpose was superseded by later linked publish work and Phase 159 release-readiness proof. | Release readiness / archive traceability | operational failure in linked release proof or explicit strategy change in release process |
| SEED-002 | dormant future roadmap | Ecosystem integrations are useful blueprints but are not v1.48 closeout blockers and do not create default milestone scope. | Future roadmap / ecosystem integrations | concrete adopter failure requiring one listed integration, repeated support issue, or explicit strategy change |
| ENT-EXT-01 | deferred | Rich metered, tiered, and range entitlement math is beyond current seat-count support and lacks a sourced adopter contract. | Entitlements extension | concrete adopter failure or explicit adopter contract requiring richer entitlement math |
| FIN-03 | standing non-goal | App-owned finance exports remain outside Accrue's declared billing-library scope. | Strategy non-goal / finance exports | explicit strategy change or correctness/security/data-loss risk that cannot be solved by host-owned exports |

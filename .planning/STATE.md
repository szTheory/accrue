# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-09-12)

**Core value:** A Phoenix developer can install Accrue and its companion admin UI and launch a real SaaS with subscription billing on day one, without avoidable integration or release risk.

**Current focus:** Phase 229 — Repository Truth & Recovery Safety

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1.62 is release integration and repository hygiene only; no product capability is in scope.
- Published history and the v1.61 tag remain immutable: no force-push, tag movement, destructive cleanup, required-check weakening, merge to `main`, Release Please merge, or package publication.
- Phase order is repository truth/safety → integration candidate → exact-SHA gate proof → bounded hygiene and release handoff.
- Cleanup must be evidence-backed and stops when only subjective nits remain.
- [Phase 229]: Freeze every refs/** row before creating Phase 229 preservation refs, then verify both named refs and bundle membership.
- [Phase 229]: Persist only allowlisted, relative typed artifact evidence; external recovery locations and content remain private.
- [Phase 229]: Phase 229 monitor permits only repository-bound list, inspect, and bounded watch reads.
- [Phase 229]: Legacy branch selection is resolved to a full SHA before watch polling, while explicit SHA bypasses selection.
- [Phase 229]: Actions success remains provider_proof non_run absent independent provider evidence.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Remote `main` and the v1.61 lineage have diverged; the local `main` ref is stale and independently divergent.
- Four audit-closure commits are not published, and the required live-CI monitor is unavailable; both need honest evidence or an explicit waiver before release handoff.
